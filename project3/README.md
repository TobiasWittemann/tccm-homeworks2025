# MD: Argon Molecular Dynamics Simulation
A Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation program written in Fortran. This program simulates a system of Argon atoms interacting via the **Lennard-Jones potential**, utilizing the **Velocity Verlet** algorithm for numerical integration of the equations of motion.

Run the python script (track_energy.py) to track the E(tot) in function of time steps it in the same directory where traj.xyz will be located or provide a path to traj.xyz when running.
